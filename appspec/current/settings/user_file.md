# Input of an auxiliary/user file

!> Note that this setting has been created to replace the deprecated [`LOCAL_FILE`](appspec/current/settings/local_file.md) setting. 


It is possible to design Apps that require auxiliary files, e.g. a map with environmental information, that are useful for analysis with the tracking data. The App needs the auxiliary files during its run time. Therefore, they have to be either provided permanently by the App developer or uploaded to MoveApps from a local system by the App user. This leads to three types of auxiliary files that are described in more details in the section about [Auxiliary Files](auxiliary.md).

In the `appspec.json`, these auxiliary files can be addressed by a setting named `USER_FILE` that defines a single own auxiliary file that the user can upload in the process of Workflow setup. The settings window has to be defined as specified in the below example. Note that (different from the deprecated `LOCAL_FILE` setting) the name of the file does not have to exactly match any name, but the file type/extension only, which the App developer should provide to the users in the settings description. That way we overcome the problem that wrong file names have led to App errors in the past. However, this improvement comes at the price that upload of multiple files is only possible as .zip files or by adding several `USER_FILE` settings. Note that handling of zip-files (i.e. unzip) must be addressed in the code of the respective App.


```
*appspec.json*

{
  "id": "aux_A",
  "name": "My auxiliary shapefile zip",
  "description": "File for running the XY analysis. The App expects a zipped set of files with the extensions: 1. `.cpg`, 2. `.dbf`, 3. `.prj`, 4. `.shp`, 5. `.shx`.",
  "type": "USER_FILE"
},
{
  "id": "aux_B",
  "name": "My auxiliary geotiff",
  "description": "File for running the YZ analysis. The App expects a geotiff file with the extension: `.geotiff`.",
  "type": "USER_FILE"
}
```

!> Note that file extensions do not matter for the transmission process, but can be part of a message that the App developer gives to the App user, so that the correct files are uploaded.

If the App developer can/wants to provide either fixed or fallback auxiliary files (which we recommend), these files must be defined as `providedAppFiles`. This category of the `appspec.json` defines the ID by which the auxiliary/user file can be addressed and its location in the App file bundle.


```
*appspec.json*

"providedAppFiles": [
  {
    "settingId": "aux_A",
    "from": "provided-app-files/aux_A/"
  }
]
```
