# Movement analysis resources

This page contains resources to consult when you would like to learn more about analysing movement data, tools that can be used, and when to apply which method to your data.

## AniMove eLearning

[AniMove](https://animove.org/) is a non-profit initiative that organises two-week intensive training for studying and analysing animal movement in combination with environmental information. AniMove now provides the option to participate through eLearning. On their website, you can find [lecture recordings](https://animove.org/lecture-recordings-2024/) and [teaching material](https://animove.org/copy-elearning-downloads/) free of charge. This allows anyone to learn about animal movement analyses in combination with environmental information. The AniMove training can teach you to analyse animal movement data using mainly R. However, the eLearning can also help you to define which methods to use for which purpose, which may help you in choosing the right [Apps](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser) to add to your [Workflows](create_workflow.md).

## ECODATA

Tool to access and process remote sensing.

Overview and instructions can be found here: https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-content/ecodata

Peer reviewed paper presenting the toolbox: Missik, J. E. et al. (2025). ECODATA: A toolbox to efficiently explore and communicate animal movements alongside environmental and anthropogenic context using geospatial big data. Methods in Ecology and Evolution. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.70141

Pre-release with improved annotation tool (still being tested): https://github.com/jemissik/ecodata/releases/tag/v0.3.0-beta

ECODATA can be used in combination with MoveApps in both directions:
- MoveApps - ECODATA: Prepare and explore your data in MoveApps and export them as a csv file to upload to ECODATA.
- ECODATA - MoveApps: Prepare your environmental data in ECODATA and upload the obtained rasters in Apps that allow/require upload of environmental layers.
