# Update of 'Your Workflows'

![updates](ownWF_overview.png)

Here comes the announced big change of the layout of the 'Your Workflows' section. Now you can search within your workflows and sort them by different criteria. Hopefully, after getting used to the change, it will make finding Workflows and working with them easier. [Here](https://docs.moveapps.org/#/create_workflow?id=overview-of-39your-workflows39) you can find a detailed description of the new layout.
