Are you using Earth Observation (EO) data in your work? Help us gain better insights into how you access, process, and analyze this data. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes of your time. Your contribution is greatly appreciated!

This survey is conducted within the scope of SOS (www.dfg-sos.de), a joint research project of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the University of WÃ¼rzburg, and the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. Our goal is to create a user-friendly framework for analyzing Earth Observation data, particularly for integrating it with animal movement data. A key outcome will be to connect MoveApps with EO data platforms, enabling more efficient analysis of movement data within its environmental context.
